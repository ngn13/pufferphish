## üòã Setup
### ...with Docker 
You can easily setup pufferphish with docker (assuming you already have docker installed):
```
git clone https://github.com/ngn13/pufferphish.git && cd pufferphish 
docker build -t pufferphish .
docker run -d -v $PWD/config.json:/app/config.json \
              -v $PWD/templates:/app/templates     \
              -v $PWD/logs:/app/logs               \
              -p 80:8080                           \
              pufferphish
```
Note that you will need restart the container after changing the configuration.

### ...without Docker
First install a recent version of `nodejs` and `npm`.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ngn13/pufferphish.git && cd pufferphish
npm install
npm run start
```

You can use nginx reverse proxy for HTTPS. Here is configuration that you can 
copy and paste:
```conf
server {
  server_name   [domain];

  location / {
    proxy_pass http://localhost:[port];
    proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
    proxy_http_version 1.1;
    proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
    proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
    proxy_set_header Host $host;
    proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
  }
